### Bubble Sort

- The <b>"swap"</b> where we compare pairs of number in array/list and swapped them if the first item in the pair was greater than the second

- The <b>"loop"</b> that runs the swap <b>n</b> times, where <b>n</b> is the size of the list we are sorting

Pseudo code :

```
for pair(first, second) in pairs {
  if (first > second) {
    swap(first, second)
  }
  else {
    // Do nothing
  }
}
```
